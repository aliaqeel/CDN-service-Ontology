# CDN-service-Ontology

This project involved crafting an elaborate ontology through the utilization of the OWL (Web Ontology Language) methodology. Additionally, I formulated an application profile model for a Content Delivery Network (CDN) service. The CDN was designed to encompass a minimum of 3 microservices and numerous parameters, all of which would elucidate the interconnections among Application consumers, Microservices, Data sources, Network traffic and load, Deployment context, as well as Security and access control policies.
